# Anti-Detection Fixes for UPS Tracking Scraper

## Problem
You were getting "Access Denied" errors when trying to scrape UPS tracking information. This happens because UPS's website uses various anti-bot measures to block automated requests.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Browser Arguments
Added comprehensive browser launch arguments to make the browser appear more like a real user:
- Disabled automation detection features
- Added realistic user agent strings
- Disabled various browser features that bots typically don't use
- Added SSL/certificate error handling

### 2. Stealth Measures
Implemented JavaScript code to hide automation indicators:
- Removed `navigator.webdriver` property
- Overrode browser plugins and languages
- Modified permissions API behavior
- Added realistic HTTP headers

### 3. Human-like Behavior
Added random delays and realistic browsing patterns:
- Random wait times before navigation
- Proper viewport settings
- Cookie consent handling
- Multiple fallback approaches for content extraction

## Files Updated

### `server.js`
- Enhanced with all anti-detection measures
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Improved content extraction logic

### `scrape.js`
- Updated standalone script with same protections
- Better tracking information extraction
- Mobile-friendly approach

### `alternative-scrape.js` (NEW)
- Uses mobile user agent
- Different approach to avoid detection
- Multiple fallback methods for finding tracking data

### `test-fixes.js` (NEW)
- Test script to verify if anti-detection measures work
- Helps diagnose if you're still being blocked

## How to Use

### Option 1: Test the Fixes
```bash
node test-fixes.js
```
This will test if the anti-detection measures are working.

### Option 2: Use the Updated Server
```bash
node server.js
```
Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Option 3: Use the Updated Standalone Script
```bash
node scrape.js
```

### Option 4: Try the Alternative Approach
```bash
node alternative-scrape.js
```

## If You're Still Getting Blocked

If you're still getting "Access Denied" errors, try these additional steps:

1. **Use a VPN**: Change your IP address
2. **Try different times**: Some websites have different blocking rules at different times
3. **Use a proxy service**: Rotate IP addresses
4. **Reduce request frequency**: Add longer delays between requests
5. **Try the mobile version**: The alternative script uses a mobile user agent

## Additional Tips

- **Don't run too many requests quickly**: This can trigger rate limiting
- **Use real tracking numbers**: Test with actual UPS tracking numbers
- **Monitor the browser window**: The scripts run with `headless: false` so you can see what's happening
- **Check for CAPTCHAs**: Some sites may show CAPTCHAs instead of blocking

## Troubleshooting

If you see the browser window but get no tracking data:
1. Check if the page loaded completely
2. Look for cookie consent banners that need to be clicked
3. Verify the tracking number is valid
4. Try the alternative script with mobile user agent

## Legal Note

Remember that web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites. Consider using official APIs when available, and respect rate limits and robots.txt files.
